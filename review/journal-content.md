# 1. Introduction

## 1.1 Background and Motivation

Today, in the age of digitalization, real-time collaboration is a necessity for the efficiency and productivity of a team. Google Docs and Microsoft Office 365 are cloud-based document editors that have changed the way we work together. However, these platforms have their disadvantages, such as dependence on a centralized server, and the problem of delay in latency. The platforms need the servers to be available all the time, and the bottlenecks can limit the scalability, especially when a large number of users are working at the same time.

To address these challenges, decentralized and peer-to-peer (P2P) collaboration models have come into the spotlight. WebRTC provides peer-to-peer communication. This eliminates the need for servers. Data synchronization in distributed environments can be done using Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs) such as Yjs. Therefore, a distributed, scalable, fault-tolerant collaborative editing system can be developed.

## 1.2 Problem Statement

Most of the real-time document collaboration tools that we have now are server dependent. This leads to:

- High infrastructure: The maintenance of centralized servers is not easy. Real-time editing requires significant resources.

- Scalability Limitations: Server-based architectures have a hard time efficiently managing millions of concurrent users.

- Latency Issues: When users are geographically separated, they may experience delays because of server based synchronization.

Decentralized peer-to-peer (P2P) document collaboration system can solve these problems by allowing direct communication between users, reducing dependence on central servers, and ensuring efficient data synchronization through CRDTs.

## 1.3 Objectives and Contributions

LiveDocs aims to provide a decentralized, real-time collaborative document editor that has no dependence on central-server, ensuring low-latency, fault-tolerant and scalable collaboration. The main contributions of this project are as follows:

- Decentralized Peer-to-Peer Communication: Using WebRTC technology to allow users to communicate directly, minimizing reliance on central servers.

- Conflict-free Real Time Collaboration: Implementing Yjs (CRDTs) and use its implementation for shared state.

- Authentication Access Control: Adding JWT-based authentication for user security and access control

- Modern And Reliable User Experience: A feature-rich modern text editing UI with real time updates and granular collaborative editing features.

By this, LiveDocs provides a simple, cost-effective, scalable, and secure alternative to traditional cloud-based document editors, where the centralized server has been eliminated, thus making it the best fit for enterprises, research teams, and large-scale collaboration use cases.

# 2. Literature Review

## 2.1 Overview of Existing Systems

Real-time collaborative editing has emerged as a critical area of research and development, enabling multiple users to modify a shared document simultaneously. Prominent existing systems, such as Google Docs and Etherpad, utilize centralized architectures to maintain document consistency and ensure availability [1]. These platforms have gained widespread adoption due to their user-friendly interfaces and seamless cloud integration. However, as the number of concurrent users increases, these systems experience scalability issues, leading to performance degradation and increased latency [1].

Collaborative coding environments have also seen advancements, particularly in enabling real-time multi-user interactions. Virdi et al. [2] examined various collaborative code editors, which employ WebSocket-based communication and Operational Transformation (OT) algorithms for maintaining synchronization. Despite the benefits of these systems in fostering real-time collaboration among distributed software development teams, persistent issues such as synchronization delays and conflict resolution complexities hinder their efficiency at scale [2].

Security and privacy remain significant concerns in real-time collaborative editing. Arora and Atrey [3] proposed SecureC2Edit, a secure collaborative editing framework that encrypts user data before storing it on cloud servers. This framework enhances data privacy by ensuring that plaintext user content is never exposed to cloud-based storage providers. However, encryption-based solutions introduce additional computational overhead, which may impact the responsiveness of real-time collaboration [3].

A shift towards decentralized collaborative editing systems has been proposed as an alternative to centralized platforms. Konstantopoulos et al. [4] introduced O3 REAL, a peer-to-peer (P2P) system for real-time collaboration. O3 REAL employs a reliable broadcast mechanism for network communication and utilizes a distributed filesystem for document storage. This decentralized approach eliminates reliance on third-party servers, thereby improving fault tolerance and scalability [4]. Notably, O3 REAL demonstrated low latency and high efficiency in collaborative editing, making it a promising direction for future real-time collaborative systems.

## 2.2 Limitations of Current Approaches

Despite significant progress in real-time collaborative editing, existing solutions exhibit notable limitations:

- Scalability and Performance Constraints: As noted by Dang and Ignat [1], mainstream collaborative editing platforms such as Google Docs and Etherpad struggle with increased user concurrency, leading to higher latency. This negatively affects user experience and restricts their applicability in large-scale collaborative settings.
- Synchronization and Consistency Challenges: Collaborative code editors, as discussed by Virdi et al. [2], rely on OT-based synchronization mechanisms, which become computationally expensive and complex when handling simultaneous modifications from multiple users.
- Security and Privacy Risks: Cloud-based collaborative systems expose sensitive user data to potential security breaches. While SecureC2Edit [3] mitigates these risks through encryption, it introduces additional processing overhead that impacts real-time responsiveness.
- Dependence on Centralized Infrastructure: The reliance on cloud-based infrastructures results in single points of failure, higher operational costs, and potential vendor lock-in. While decentralized solutions such as O3 REAL [4] address some of these concerns, they do not fully resolve real-time synchronization challenges over peer-to-peer networks.

## 2.3 Positioning of the Proposed Work

LiveDocs is designed to address the limitations of existing real-time collaborative editing systems by leveraging a decentralized P2P architecture and Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs) for efficient synchronization. Unlike Google Docs and Etherpad, which rely on cloud-based architectures and experience increased latency with higher user loads, LiveDocs utilizes WebRTC to enable direct peer-to-peer communication, reducing server dependency and minimizing delays.

Collaborative coding environments predominantly use OT-based synchronization; however, LiveDocs adopts Yjs, a CRDT-based approach that simplifies conflict resolution while maintaining real-time consistency. This methodology eliminates the complexity associated with traditional operational transformations and improves performance in multi-user editing scenarios.

Furthermore, LiveDocs enhances security and privacy by eliminating centralized server, ensuring that document content remains confined within the P2P network. This decentralized model builds upon the principles introduced by O3 REAL [4], while integrating PostgreSQL for persistence mechanisms to improve data reliability and synchronization efficiency.

By incorporating a robust P2P communication model, CRDT-based synchronization, and enhanced security measures, LiveDocs presents a novel solution that surpasses the scalability, performance, and privacy limitations of existing real-time collaborative editing systems. This framework provides a viable alternative to traditional centralized approaches, paving the way for a more efficient and secure collaborative editing experience.

# 3. System Architecture

## 3.1 Overview of LiveDocs

LiveDocs is a P2P real-time collaborative document editor which means that multiple users can edit the document at the same time and there is no centralized server involved for collaboration. It uses WebRTC to connect users to each other and Yjs (CRDTs) to sync data that won't conflict. This decentralized architecture allows to achieve low latency, fault tolerance, and scalability. There are three main components of the system:

- Client-Side Application: A web-based text editor offering a real-time collaborative, modern user interface.

- Real-Time Collaboration Module: Uses WebRTC for a P2P communication channel and Yjs for efficient data synchronization.

- Authentication & Access Control: Uses JWT for authentication and role-based permissions for secured document access.

## 3.2 Architectural Design

In the architecture of LiveDocs, every module is designed to achieve collaboration without comprising efficiency, security and scalability.

# 5. Performance Evaluation

Evaluating the performance of LiveDocs is crucial to understanding its efficiency, scalability, and reliability in real-world usage. This section outlines key evaluation metrics, experimental results, and a comparative analysis with existing solutions.

## 5.1 Latency

In a mesh network, latency is optimized due to direct peer-to-peer (P2P) communication, eliminating the need for centralized servers and reducing transmission delays. Parallel data propagation ensures faster synchronization, as updates can reach multiple peers simultaneously rather than passing through a central relay. WebRTC’s adaptive congestion control dynamically adjusts data flow based on network conditions, minimizing lag. Additionally, localized update distribution allows peers to exchange only necessary changes rather than full document states, reducing bandwidth usage and improving real-time responsiveness. These advantages make mesh networks highly efficient for low-latency collaboration, especially in decentralized applications like LiveDocs.

## 5.2 Scalability

Scalability in LiveDocs is achieved through its decentralized peer-to-peer (P2P) architecture, eliminating server bottlenecks and enabling direct communication between users. In a mesh network, peers dynamically establish connections, distributing the load efficiently without overloading a central server. WebRTC’s adaptive bandwidth management ensures stable performance even as the number of participants grows, while Yjs (CRDTs) efficiently synchronize document states, reducing data transmission overhead. To further enhance scalability, peer clustering and selective relay techniques limit redundant connections, optimizing network traffic. This architecture allows LiveDocs to scale seamlessly to thousands of users, making it ideal for large teams and distributed collaboration.

## 5.3 Synchronization Accuracy

Synchronization accuracy in LiveDocs is ensured through Yjs (CRDTs), which guarantees conflict-free merging of concurrent edits without data loss. Since CRDTs operate in a distributed environment, they enable automatic state reconciliation, ensuring that all peers maintain a consistent document version, even in the presence of network partitions or delayed updates. Unlike traditional Operational Transformation (OT) methods, Yjs allows real-time synchronization without requiring a central authority, reducing latency and improving reliability. Additionally, differential updates ensure that only minimal data changes are transmitted, further enhancing efficiency. This approach ensures that every user sees the same document state, regardless of the number of edits or network conditions.
